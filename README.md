# GifPedia
Sending requests to the Giphy-API

# Install
1. npm i
2. npm start
3. Go to localhost:3000/
4. Enjoy

# Ways to use
1. You can either enter anything in the search box then push "search" to see the Gifs of the entered search.
2. Push the "trending" button to get the most popular Gifs on Giphy.com
3. "Small", "Medium" and "Large" are resizing buttons if you want to increase or decrease the Gif size once the images have been fetched.

# Things to note
I stuck to the 4 hour max limit. I implemented as many features as I could in that time frame. I wanted to implement
a slider for the Gif resizing however that would have taken slightly longer. As well as adding a welcome screen on site root.

Thanks again,
Sandeep
